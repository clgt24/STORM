## Create new category based on the days of the week
mergeData$DayCategory <- ifelse(mergeData$day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "Weekend", "Weekday")
Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = “l”) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).

library(lattice) 

## Summarize data by interval and type of day
intervalTable2 <- ddply(mergeData, .(interval, DayCategory), summarize, Avg = mean(steps))

##Plot data in a panel plot
xyplot(Avg~interval|DayCategory, data=intervalTable2, type="l",  layout = c(1,2),
       main="Average Steps per Interval Based on Type of Day", 
       ylab="Average Number of Steps", xlab="Interval")
